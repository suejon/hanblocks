# Han Blocks

This app was created as a way to experiment with some modern front end technologies that support the NextJS stack, while at the same time, providing a tool which i could use to learn Korean.

It's a simple dictionary lookup which is quick and to-the-point. The current dicitonary service provided by Naver is great but it often has a lot more information than i need as a Korean learner. Not to mention, its mobile app is just the embedded web app which is clunky and slow.

Feel free to check it out here:

If this is useful for you too and there is a feature which you think could be helpful for learning Korean, please let me know.
